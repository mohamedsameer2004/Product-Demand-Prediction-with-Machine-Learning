## Overview

Our project aimed to predict product demand using machine learning. We explored various models and techniques to create a robust demand prediction system.

## Dataset

**Source:** The dataset used in our project was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chakradharmattapalli/product-demand-prediction-with-machine-learning. This dataset was a comprehensive collection of historical data related to product demand, encompassing details such as Store ID, Total Price, Base Price, and Units Sold. The richness of the dataset provided us with a solid foundation for building predictive models.

**Description:** The dataset includes a diverse set of features, allowing for a nuanced exploration of the factors influencing product demand. Each entry represents a unique combination of parameters, capturing the dynamics of sales in different scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DeepakV-7/DataScience-ProductDemand.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd product-demand-prediction
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the demand prediction model:

```bash
python predict_demand.py
```

Provide any additional instructions or command-line options here.
